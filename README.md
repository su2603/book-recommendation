Implements the `BookRecommender` class for a modular, production-grade book recommendation pipeline.

### 2. `bookRecSystem.py` - Exploratory Script
Performs dataset analysis, visualizations, and initial model testing.

### 3. `model_extractor.py` - Model Debug Utility
Loads and extracts internals from serialized recommender models.

### 4. `load_model.py` - CLI Tool

## üß† BookRecommender Class

### üîß Configuration (default in `self.config`)
| Key                      | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `popularity_threshold`   | Minimum ratings to consider a book in popularity model |
| `user_interactions_threshold` | Minimum user activity required for SVD |
| `rating_threshold`       | Minimum ratings a user must give to be used in KNN |
| `book_ratings_threshold_perc` | Top % of rated books to keep in KNN |
| `svd_factors`            | Number of latent factors in SVD |
| `content_batch_size`     | Batching size to avoid memory overflow in content model |

---

## üßπ Preprocessing Stages

### Users
- Normalize age (5‚Äì100) and country info
- Extract `Country` from `Location`
- Fill NaN with country-median or global mean

### Books
- Convert `Year-Of-Publication` to int16
- Fix anomalous records by ISBN
- Drop image URLs to save memory

### Ratings
- Remove implicit ratings (rating == 0)
- Add average rating and rating count per book
- Merge all into `self.final_dataset`

## ü§ñ Recommendation Models

### 1. Popularity-Based Filtering
- Weighted average: `(v/(v+m) * R) + (m/(m+v) * C)`
- Uses 90th percentile rating threshold

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (KNN)
- Uses cosine similarity between items
- Ratings matrix: users vs books
- Built with `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors`

### 3. Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Filters inactive users
- Applies log smoothing
- Decomposes rating matrix with `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`

### 4. Content-Based Filtering
- TF-IDF vectorizer on: `Title + Author + Publisher`
- Similarity: Cosine distance with target book vector
- Calculates similarities in batches

### 5. Hybrid Model
- Merges outputs from all other models
- Priority order: Content > Item CF > SVD > Popularity
